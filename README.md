# hello-world
My first repository folder 

Hi folks, my name is Oma and this is my first attempt at trying to code. I have a first degree in public health and I am very excited for this journey and all the new languages I'll learn. 
I hope this inspires anyone who dares to take a step towards that which scares them, because “Coming out of your comfort zone is tough in the beginning, chaotic in the middle, and awesome in the end...because in the end, it shows you a whole new world !!
Make an attempt..”― Manoj Arora.
